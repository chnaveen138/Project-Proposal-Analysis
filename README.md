# Project-Proposal-Analysis
Donors choose is popular website which empowers public school teachers from across the country to request much-needed materials and experiences for their students. It receives thousands of projects proposals each year and more man power is needed to screen each project proposal and approve it. Using modern machine learning techniques I tried to automate this task. The model built in this ipython notebook suggests whether given projet proposal can be approved or rejected. Model is built by training on lakhs of data points provided by donorschoose.org through kaggle. Ipython notebook goes through stages like data acquisition, data preparation like data cleaning and data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, modelling, interpretation, deployment. Presentation of results is done in a crystal clear way. The main features of the data are description about essay(project_essay) and the project title which are text features and inorder to convert them into numerical vectors techniques like bag of words, tf-idf, word2vec, tf-idf weighted word2vec are used. Data is visualized using t-SNE(t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding). Popular machine learning algorithms like k-nearest neighbors, multinomial naive bayes, logistic regression, support vector machine(linear kernels), decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting are used and hyper parameter tuned to find the best model.
